# The COVID-19 Pandemic in Latin America, A Year Later: Interdisciplinary Insights

This repo contains the data, code and graphs I used for the presentation I gave on March 2, 2021, during the seminar [_The COVID-19 Pandemic in Latin America, A Year Later: Interdisciplinary Insights_](https://plas.princeton.edu/sites/g/files/toruqf481/files/2021-02/3.2COVID-19inLatinAmerica.pdf), organized by Princeton's, [PLAS](https://plas.princeton.edu/).

Almost all the data I used can be located in the folder `01_data` or downloaded with the script `01_load_prepare_data.R`. The file `210301COVID19MEXICO.csv` is too big to be uploaded to GitHub, but it can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XyioTZumpNV73o9MFy70N4kUsMPJ3s8Q/view?usp=sharing).
